![Screenshot](/assets/img/projects/rover.jpg){:style="width: 75%; height: auto;"}

#### Description
The Lunar Robotic Operator for Autonomous Development of Surface Trails and Exploration Routes (Lunar ROADSTER) is an autonomous moon-working rover, capable of finding exploration routes and grooming the lunar surface to develop traversable surface trails. These groomed trails will become the backbone for the colonization of the Moon by enabling transportation, logistics, and enterprise development.

## Long-Run IPO Underperformance Long/Short Hedging

![Screenshot](/assets/img/projects/backtest.png){:style="width: 75%; height: auto;"}

#### Description
Backtested and implemented a cash- and market-neutral long/short strategy of shorting a recently IPO-ed stock and longing an offsetting ETF. The strategy hopes to use the empirical evidence of long-run underperformance of initial public offerings (IPO) to potentially exploit arbitrage opportunities (see [[Ritter, 1998]](https://site.warrington.ufl.edu/ritter/files/CFD.pdf)). Completed as a part of project coursework for the subject Algorithmic Trading (FNCE30010) at the University of Melbourne.
