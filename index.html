<h3 style="font-size: 24px;">Hi there, I'm Boxiang (William) Fu!</h3>

Iâ€™m currently pursuing my <a href="https://mrsd.ri.cmu.edu/">Master of Science in Robotic Systems Development (MRSD)</a> at Carnegie Mellon University. <br><br>

I completed my undergraduate studies at the <a href="https://www.unimelb.edu.au/">University of Melbourne</a> with a Bachelor of Science (Mathematical Physics), 
Bachelor of Commerce (Economics & Finance), and Diploma in Languages (Chinese Studies). 

I was the University Medalist (Rank: 1st/1800+) for my BCom cohort and the Proxime Accessit (Rank: 2nd/2400+) for my BSci cohort. <br><br>


During my undergraduate studies, I completed research assistantships at the <a href="https://mpl.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/">Mobile Perception Lab</a>
(ShanghaiTech University) working on Non-Rigid Multi-Perspective Camera Pose Estimation, BTQ Lab (Macquarie University) working on Quantum Proof of Work Algorithms,
and the University of Melbourne working on Geothermal Energy: Economics and Technical Viability. <br><br>

Currently, I am broadly interested in <b>Robot Autonomy</b>, <b>Controls</b> and <b>SLAM</b>.
In a past life, I was interested in <b>General Topology</b>, <b>Quantum Computing</b>, and <b>Cryptography</b>.
