# Divagations

> **Divagations**: *Noun*. A departure from the subject under consideration.

### Philosophy

I mainly use this page to share resources that I find useful but is often overlooked in the undergraduate educational curriculum.

### Coherent Proof Writing

Proof writing is an art. However, it is seldom taught in the undergraduate mathematics curriculum. 
It takes a lot of practice to improve upon writing coherent proofs. A very useful technique taught by Prof. Arun Ram (my Metric and Hilbert Spaces instructor) is called 
**Proof Machine**. I found it to be extremely helpful in my exposition. In Prof. Ram's words:

> To prove 'If A then B', ***Assume*** the ifs and ***To show*** the thens, and that’s about all there is to it. The rest is just practice.

You can find Prof. Ram's notes on Proof Machine [here](http://math.soimeme.org/~arunram/Teaching/2022MetricHilbert/ProofMachine220630.pdf).

### Construction of the Complex Numbers from Reals from Rationals from Integers from Naturals from Sets

This meme sums it pretty well:

In all seriousness, the real numbers is ubiquitous in its usage. Yet so few analysis courses teach how to construct it from scratch (i.e. ZFC set theory). 
It is in my belief that any competent student majoring in pure mathematics should construct it (or at least know how to) once in their undergraduate course of studies. 
I found [this](https://www.math.uni-konstanz.de/~krapp/research/Constructions_of_the_real_numbers.pdf) online resouce by Dr. Sebastian Krapp very useful. 
The construction of the natural numbers can be done through induction on empty sets (see [von Neumann ordinals](http://mathfoundations.lti.cs.cmu.edu/class2/naturals.html)). 
The extension to the complex numbers is trivial (see [Hamilton’s construction](/assets/img/docs/complex_numbers.pdf))

### Bra-Ket Notation in Quantum Mechanics

We often use this for granted. Yet the reasoning behind why it works is often left unexplained in introductory (sometimes even graduate) QM courses. 
The reason why Bra-Ket works is because of the [Riesz Representation Theorem](https://fiveable.me/spectral-theory/unit-2/riesz-representation-theorem/study-guide/J3MuZ0kpur4LRRF1). A proof sketch can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_1w1yW45vHlwM31FHOFXmR8kRdYdDqNs/view?usp=sharing) (pp. 20 to 23).

### Compactness and Completeness

This photo basically sums up compactness. It generalizes the fundamental theorems of [Bolzano–Weierstrass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolzano%E2%80%93Weierstrass_theorem) and [Heine–Borel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heine%E2%80%93Borel_theorem), which is almost always taught in an undergraduate analysis course.
